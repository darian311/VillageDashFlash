My first click management game written in actionscript. 

There's about 5 minutes of game play in this prototype.  I designed the game to pull it's settings directly from a set of Google Spreadsheets. 
The folder of spreadsheets which you can copy and use in your own Google Drive account is: https://drive.google.com/a/villagethegame.com/folderview?id=0B-zdryEj60U_WVYzdmNSMkY3bms&usp=sharing
